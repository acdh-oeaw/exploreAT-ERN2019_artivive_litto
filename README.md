Important: Frames should have a counting number system, e.g. 01 to 08 (or the number of the last frame, in that case it is 08) 
3.1 Add the files with the Script LOAD FILES INTO STACK. then ypu collect all the files you want to add and load it into Photoshop
3.2 In the layer options you will see your files, check if they are in the right order: 01 should be on the top and 08 on the bottom of the layers.
